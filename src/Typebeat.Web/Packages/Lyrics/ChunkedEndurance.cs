///
/// <para>WHAT IT ASKS. The envelope model reads a map as one number built from its hardest
/// window and how much of the range the rest of the material fills. This axis asks a different
/// question: score the map's own windows directly, then take the decay-weighted mean of those
/// scores with the hardest weighted most. The result is a star figure on its own scale: on this
/// axis <c>starScale</c> is the anchor rather than <c>anchor / (1 + range)</c>, and
/// <c>difficult</c>/<c>demanding</c> are both the weighted length count the pp figure prices a
/// miss against.</para>
///
/// <para>TWO LAYOUTS, ONE AXIS. <see cref="Settings.chunk_profile"/> picks which window family
/// the map is read through, and the sandbox's saved configuration - which
/// <see cref="Settings.Live"/> mirrors - selects <see cref="profile_overlapping"/>:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description>the CHUNK grid (<see cref="profile_chunks"/>), which the axis was first
/// ported for: equal chunks, the hardest chunk's start as the anchor so the hardest material is
/// never split, a pause gate, and adjacent runs lifted where material straddles a boundary;</description></item>
/// <item><description>the OVERLAPPING family (<see cref="profile_overlapping"/>), which the game
/// now ships: the timeline is sampled at a regular step, each sample keeps the strongest of a
/// doubling family of windows tried at its start, centre and end, a window holding fewer than
/// <see cref="Settings.minimum_chars"/> characters is refused, and each sample consumes rank in
/// proportion to its own support.</description></item>
/// </list>
/// The chunk dials stay live for the first layout and the overlapping dials for the second,
/// exactly as the sandbox keeps both on its panel.</para>
///
/// <para>WHAT IT DOES NOT READ. The peak-window scan, the envelope sweep, the strain
/// accumulation, the catch-up walk, stamina and the burst window. The chunked rating is
/// <c>anchor x score x (1 + length bonus)</c> and nothing else; porting the rest "for
/// completeness" is what made the sandbox slow.</para>
///
/// <para>ONE INPUT THE ENVELOPE MODEL DOES NOT HAVE. A chunk's strain is multiplied by the
