/// <para>WHAT IT ASKS. The envelope model reads a map as one number built from its hardest
/// window and how much of the range the rest of the material fills. This axis asks a different
/// question: cut the whole thing into equal chunks, let the HARDEST chunk's start anchor the
/// grid so the hardest material is never split, score every chunk as a window in its own right,
/// lift adjacent runs where material straddles a boundary, then take the decay-weighted mean of
/// the chunk scores with the hardest weighted most. The result is a star figure on its own
/// scale: on this axis <c>starScale</c> is the anchor rather than <c>anchor / (1 + range)</c>,
/// and <c>difficult</c>/<c>demanding</c> are both the weighted length count the pp figure prices
/// a miss against.</para>
///
/// <para>WHAT IT DOES NOT READ. The peak-window scan, the envelope sweep, the strain
/// accumulation, the catch-up walk, stamina and the burst window. The chunked rating is
/// <c>anchor x score x (1 + length bonus)</c> and nothing else; porting the rest "for
/// completeness" is what made the sandbox slow.</para>
///
/// <para>ONE INPUT THE ENVELOPE MODEL DOES NOT HAVE. A chunk's strain is multiplied by the
/// rhythm boost INSIDE that window, read off a load prefix over the map's own keypress stream
