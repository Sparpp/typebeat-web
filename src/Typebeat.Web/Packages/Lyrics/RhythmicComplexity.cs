/// The rhythmic-complexity bonus: stars for the extent to which keeping perfect timing means
/// CHANGING typing pace, weighted toward the map's demanding passages.
///
/// <para>THE QUESTION IT ASKS. Not "how fast is this map" (the envelope already prices that)
/// but "how much timing does one constant pace <c>t = a + b*key</c> fail to reach". A stretch
/// a player can cover at a single constant speed pays EXACTLY nothing, however much its word
/// durations wobble, because the game's judgement windows absorb the wobble. Only timing
/// outside the allowed intervals is charged, and it is charged through a WEIGHTED MINIMAX: the
/// smallest <c>E</c> for which one pace fits every interval once each is widened by
/// <c>E / weight</c>, with <c>weight</c> fixed before the search as that keypress's own demand
/// over the map's peak. An easy keypress therefore gives up its own timing cheaply, and no
/// single hardest word can price a whole passage.</para>
///
/// <para>THE ROLLING METHOD (the shipped one). Every timed character is visited, and the
/// constraint at index <c>i</c> asks whether a STRAIGHT pace line can pass through three
/// Great intervals at <c>i - h</c>, <c>i</c>, <c>i + h</c>. For evenly spaced indices
/// straightness is <c>tL - 2*tM + tR = 0</c>, so the constraint's own residual is the best a
/// constant pace can do, and the weighted minimax residual of that three-point constraint is
/// <c>residual / (1/wL + 2/wM + 1/wR)</c>. Four distances (h, 2h, 4h, 8h) accumulate short and
/// long deviations, each divided by the local typing period so the same absolute error costs
/// the same share of the local typing time, and by <c>h^2</c> so overlapping checks average
/// rather than multiply. There are no sections and no split threshold: the scan is continuous,
/// so a rhythmically complex map with no rests is not underweighted.</para>
///
/// <para>RESTS. A pause BETWEEN two lyric lines is deleted from the scan outright: the next
/// line cues its own first word, so the silence is neither a rest the pace recovers inside nor
/// a rhythm the pace has to cover. A pause INSIDE a line is sung time and stays in as idle
/// recovery, which dilutes the local contribution continuously (squared, so an arbitrarily
/// long rest tends to nothing) rather than through a threshold.</para>
///
/// <para>WHAT IT IS NOT. A calibrated measurement, and not a solution to the minimum total
/// pace variation. It is a lower bound on the pace work a passage forces, against a chosen
/// experimental curve, and the strength is a dial rather than a fitted constant.</para>
