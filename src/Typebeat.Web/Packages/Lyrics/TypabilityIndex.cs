/// The Typability Index, as the difficulty model consumes it: one z-score per lyric line,
/// saying how many standard deviations faster or slower than their own average sentence the
/// typists of the 136M Keystrokes study were on that text.
///
/// <para>WHERE THE SCORES COME FROM. The index is an R regression over seven features of a
/// sentence, refit without its keystroke term so this game does not charge for keystrokes
/// twice (the envelope model already counts every cell). That regression is not reimplemented
/// here: the scores are shipped as a table computed by the Typability Lab for every lyric line
/// of the bundled Songs catalogue, in BOTH of the forms a line can be typed in — as authored
/// (the Literate mod, capitals and marks included) and as the default stripped stream
/// (<see cref="Typeability.ToDefaultStream"/>) — because the index scores those as different
/// sentences. See <c>tools/star-rating-sandbox/sync-typability.R</c> for the table and
/// <c>tools/star-rating-sandbox/sync-typability-tsv.mjs</c> for the copy embedded here; the
/// Star Rating Sandbox reads the same numbers. A line the table does not carry is UNSCORED,
/// which is the same state the sandbox is in when its R service is not running, and the
/// map-level gate below decides what an unscored line costs.</para>
///
/// <para>THE TWO GATES. A line contributes only if its score's <see cref="Score.Coverage"/>
/// clears <see cref="MinCoverage"/>: the index was fitted on English, so a line whose
/// characters mostly sit outside the US/UK/Canadian/Australian dictionaries is left unscored
/// rather than charged for words the index never saw. A MAP then takes the adjustment at all
/// only when the share of its weighted cells that carries a score clears
/// <see cref="MinScoredFraction"/>; below that the whole map is rated as if every line had
/// z = 0, which is exactly the model before typability existed. Both gates are the sandbox's
/// own dials at their shipped values.</para>
///
/// <para>WHAT A SCORE DOES. <see cref="Multiplier"/> turns a z into a scale on the capability
/// curve into the difficulty model's numerator, not a flat bonus: one z is worth
/// <see cref="Cv"/> (about 20.7%, measured across 167,478 typists) of a typist's own sentence
/// speed, so a harder line is measured against a SLOWER capability and therefore reads
/// harder. The multiplier is clamped to 0.25-4 so one odd line cannot dominate a window.</para>
///
/// <para>THE TABLE IS NOT THE ONLY SOURCE ANY MORE. <see cref="TypabilityModel"/> computes the
/// same score from the authors' own predictor calculation and the four dictionaries, which is
/// what lets a map the catalogue does not carry be scored at all. A row the table DOES carry
/// always wins (see <see cref="compute_unlisted_lines"/>), so the table stays the published
/// reading for the bundled catalogue and the computed index only ever answers for lines it does
/// not hold.</para>
