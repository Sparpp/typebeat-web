/// <summary>
/// Star rating for a lyric map: how fast the map asks you to type, measured against how fast
/// the fastest humans can type, over sliding windows of many durations (backlog 269).
///
/// <para>THE TIMELINE. Every typeable word is a block running from its onset to the end of its
/// sung span, in REAL seconds (beatmap time divided by the clock <c>rate</c>, span floored at
/// <c>min_span_ms</c>), and the block's CELLS are spread uniformly across that span into
/// <c>timeline_bin_ms</c> bins. A word's cells are its fixed-key characters plus
/// <c>freestyle_cost_weight</c> per freestyle slot, plus ONE TRAILING SPACE when the next word
/// belongs to the same line: the spacebar is a real keypress and the pace figures have always
/// counted it, so the rating counts it too.</para>
///
/// <para>THE CAPABILITY CURVE. <c>S(t) = capability_base_wpm + capability_burst_wpm *
/// (capability_ref_seconds / t) ^ capability_exponent</c> is the WPM the fastest humans sustain
/// for t seconds; it sits within 1.5% of the burst, 15 s, 60 s, 120 s and 1 hour typing records.
/// A window of t seconds holding <c>c</c> cells therefore has ratio
/// <c>(c / 5) / (t / 60) / S(t)</c>, its pace as a fraction of the record pace FOR ITS OWN
/// DURATION, which is what makes a 1.4 second burst and a 60 second verse comparable numbers.
/// Windows are drawn from a fixed schedule (see <see cref="windowSchedule"/>).</para>
///
/// <para>THE FEATS. Greedily take the highest-ratio window at ANY scheduled duration whose bins
/// are all still unconsumed, record it, consume its bins, repeat. Feats come out in
/// non-increasing ratio order and no second of the map is counted twice: a two-word burst is
/// found as a 1.4 second window, a sustained verse as a 60 second one, and the two do not
/// double count each other. Stars are the weighted sum
/// <c>stars_at_human_peak * (1 - feat_decay) * sum_k feat_decay^k * ratio_k</c> plus the length
/// bonus, so record pace for the whole map rates <c>stars_at_human_peak</c> and one lone
/// record-pace feat rates 0.75 of it. Every feat is scored against HUMAN ABILITY rather than
/// against the map's own peak, which is what makes a cut version unable to outrate the full
/// version it was cut from.</para>
///
/// <para>A MAP SHORTER THAN THE SMALLEST WINDOW rates the length term alone, i.e. very close to
/// zero. <c>window_min_s</c> of bins do not fit on its timeline, so no scheduled window fits,
/// no feat is found and the feats sum is 0. Windows are deliberately NOT clamped down to the
/// map: the ratio only means anything against <c>S(t)</c> at the window's own duration, and a
/// map with under a second and a half of singing in it is not a difficulty. Every synthetic
/// fixture in the test suites is built long enough to clear that.</para>
///
/// <para>Kept byte-for-byte in step with the game's port
/// (typebeat-osu: typebeat.Game.Rulesets.TypeBeat.Beatmaps.LyricDifficulty) so the in-game star
/// rating and the stored beatmaps.difficulty_rating always agree. The website computes the no-mod
/// baseline (rate = 1) plus the five other stored combinations; the game feeds the play's own rate
/// and stream. Any change here must be mirrored there and <see cref="LyricPace.VERSION"/> bumped so
/// existing rows recompute. The model itself is docs/sr-feats-model.js in the parent superrepo, a
/// pure function of (map, rate, constants) that this file is a literal port of.</para>
///
/// <para>Rate-adjusting mods (DoubleTime/Nightcore/HalfTime) divide every beatmap-time interval
/// by <c>rate</c> while the window schedule stays in REAL seconds: a faster clock packs the same
/// cells into fewer seconds, raising every ratio; a slower clock lowers them.</para>
///
/// <para>The LITERATE mod moves the rating the same way, through <c>literate</c>: it is a
/// CONVERSION mod on the client (IApplicableAfterBeatmapConversion), so the cells it produces ARE
/// the authored chars and every supported punctuation mark becomes a real typed cell with a target
/// time of its own. That makes the map denser, so the mod is priced through this rating exactly as
/// a rate is and carries no flat pp multiplier of its own (docs/pp.md, backlog 144). At
/// <c>literate: false</c> every word is the stripped, lower-case stream this method has always
/// measured.</para>
