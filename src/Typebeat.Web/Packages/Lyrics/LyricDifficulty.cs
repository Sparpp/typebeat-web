/// <summary>
/// Star rating for a lyric map: how fast the map asks you to type, measured against how fast
/// the fastest humans can type, over sliding windows of many durations (backlog 269, remodelled
/// by backlog 273).
///
/// <para>THE TIMELINE. Every typeable word is a block running from its onset to the end of its
/// sung span, in REAL seconds (beatmap time divided by the clock <c>rate</c>, span floored at
/// <c>min_span_ms</c>), and the block's CELLS are spread uniformly across that span into
/// <c>timeline_bin_ms</c> bins. A word's cells are its fixed-key characters plus
/// <c>freestyle_cost_weight</c> per freestyle slot, plus ONE TRAILING SPACE when the next word
/// belongs to the same line: the spacebar is a real keypress and the pace figures have always
/// counted it, so the rating counts it too.</para>
///
/// <para>THE CAPABILITY CURVE. <c>S(t) = capability_base_wpm + capability_burst_wpm *
/// (capability_ref_seconds / t) ^ capability_exponent</c> is the WPM the fastest humans sustain
/// for t seconds; it sits within 1.5% of the burst, 15 s, 60 s, 120 s and 1 hour typing records.
/// A window of t seconds holding <c>c</c> cells therefore has ratio
/// <c>(c / 5) / (t / 60) / S(t)</c>, its pace as a fraction of the record pace FOR ITS OWN
/// DURATION, which is what makes a 1.4 second burst and a 60 second verse comparable numbers.
/// Windows are drawn from a fixed schedule (see <see cref="windowSchedule"/>).</para>
///
/// <para>THE PEAK sets the RANGE. <c>ratio_0</c> is the best ratio at any scheduled duration
/// anywhere on the map, and <c>stars_at_human_peak / (1 + envelope_range) * ratio_0</c> is the
/// FLOOR of the map's range: what the hardest window alone is worth. Nothing about that figure
/// looks at the rest of the map, and it is measured against HUMAN ABILITY rather than against
/// the map's own peak, which is what stops a cut version outrating the full version it was cut
/// from.</para>
///
/// <para>THE ENVELOPE decides where inside that range the map lands. Every bin takes
/// <c>env[i]</c>, the best ratio of any scheduled window CONTAINING it (a sliding-window maximum
/// per duration, so the characters inside a sustained stretch are as hard as the stretch and a
/// burst's characters are as hard as the burst), and <c>d = min(1, env[i] / ratio_0)</c> is how
/// hard that bin is as a fraction of the peak. The map's DIFFICULT CHARACTERS are
/// <c>N = sum_i cells(i) * d^envelope_power</c>, with no cutoff, so a character at 90% of the
/// peak weighs 43%, at 70% weighs 6%, at half weighs 0.4%, and easy padding adds a little rather
/// than exactly nothing. The range fills as <c>1 - exp(-N / envelope_chars)</c>, giving
/// <c>stars = stars_at_human_peak / (1 + envelope_range) * ratio_0 *
/// (1 + envelope_range * fill)</c>: record pace with the range filled rates
/// <c>stars_at_human_peak</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>WHY NOT THE OLD FEATS (backlog 269, replaced here). Stars used to be a decaying sum
/// over greedy non-overlapping windows, so the tail credit depended on how many windows a map's
/// difficulty happened to split into: eight two-second bursts filled eight slots while two
/// sixty-second sections filled two, burst-built maps read about 7% too high, a map that was one
/// long feat had nothing to add, and a cut sharing its full version's hardest part could tie it.
/// The envelope counts CHARACTERS near the peak instead of counting windows, so how the same
/// difficulty is chopped up cannot move the rating.</para>
///
/// <para>THERE IS NO LENGTH TERM (the additive <c>0.12 * log10(cells/100)</c> of backlog 152 was
/// deleted here by 273). Length counts only through the characters it adds: padding a map with
/// easy singing raises N a little, so the rating rises a little, and padding it with hard
/// singing raises it more. Two length terms would double count that.</para>
///
/// <para>A MAP SHORTER THAN THE SMALLEST WINDOW rates EXACTLY ZERO. <c>window_min_s</c> of bins
/// do not fit on its timeline, so no scheduled window fits, <c>ratio_0</c> is 0 and so is the
/// range it scales. Windows are deliberately NOT clamped down to the map: the ratio only means
/// anything against <c>S(t)</c> at the window's own duration, and a map with under a second and
/// a half of singing in it is not a difficulty. Every synthetic fixture in the test suites is
/// built long enough to clear that.</para>
///
/// <para>Kept byte-for-byte in step with the game's port
/// (typebeat-osu: typebeat.Game.Rulesets.TypeBeat.Beatmaps.LyricDifficulty) so the in-game star
/// rating and the stored beatmaps.difficulty_rating always agree. The website computes the no-mod
/// baseline (rate = 1) plus the five other stored combinations; the game feeds the play's own rate
/// and stream. Any change here must be mirrored there and <see cref="LyricPace.VERSION"/> bumped so
/// existing rows recompute. The model itself is docs/sr-envelope-model.js in the parent superrepo, a
/// pure function of (map, rate, constants) that this file is a literal port of (its 'feats' branch
/// is the v17 model this replaced, kept as the record).</para>
///
/// <para>Rate-adjusting mods (DoubleTime/Nightcore/HalfTime) divide every beatmap-time interval
/// by <c>rate</c> while the window schedule stays in REAL seconds: a faster clock packs the same
/// cells into fewer seconds, raising every ratio; a slower clock lowers them.</para>
///
/// <para>The LITERATE mod moves the rating the same way, through <c>literate</c>: it is a
/// CONVERSION mod on the client (IApplicableAfterBeatmapConversion), so the cells it produces ARE
/// the authored chars and every supported punctuation mark becomes a real typed cell with a target
/// time of its own. That makes the map denser, so the mod is priced through this rating exactly as
/// a rate is and carries no flat pp multiplier of its own (docs/pp.md, backlog 144). At
/// <c>literate: false</c> every word is the stripped, lower-case stream this method has always
