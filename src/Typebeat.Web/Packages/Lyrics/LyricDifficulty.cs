/// <summary>
/// Star rating for a lyric map. Each word carries a keystroke load (cost × line pressure/rhythm
/// multiplier) divided by the time you have for it; that load feeds two accumulators, a fast
/// DENSITY that decays with rest and a slow ENDURANCE (a time-constant moving average of the same
/// load), and their weighted sum is the word's "strain". A duration-weighted soft maximum
/// (log-sum-exp) over the strains is remapped to stars. The soft max means difficulty spikes
/// dominate and a subset can never rate above its superset, while summing over every word (rather
/// than one peak bucket) means a sustained hard stretch actually counts: the thing that separates
/// otherwise-equal-peak diffs. Endurance is the part that survives a rest: density is deliberately
/// leaky enough now that a single burst is forgotten within a second or two, so it is endurance
/// that carries "this section has been hard for a while" into the aggregate.
///
/// Kept byte-for-byte in step with the game's port
/// (typebeat-osu: typebeat.Game.Rulesets.TypeBeat.Beatmaps.LyricDifficulty). Website computes the
/// no-mod baseline (rate = 1); the game feeds a mod-adjusted rate. Any change here must be mirrored
/// there and <see cref="LyricPace.VERSION"/> bumped so existing rows recompute.
