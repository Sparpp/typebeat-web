/// <summary>
/// Star rating for a lyric map: how fast the map asks you to type, measured against how fast
/// the fastest humans can type over many window durations, then adjusted for how hard the
/// lyrics themselves are to type and for how much the map forces the player to change pace.
///
/// <para>THE TIMELINE. Every typeable word is a block running from its onset to the end of its
/// sung span, in REAL seconds (beatmap time divided by the clock <c>rate</c>, span floored at
/// <c>min_span_ms</c>), and the block's cells are spread uniformly across that span into
/// <c>timeline_bin_ms</c> bins. A word's cells are its fixed-key characters plus
/// <c>freestyle_cost_weight</c> per freestyle slot, plus ONE TRAILING SPACE when the next word
/// belongs to the same line: the spacebar is a real keypress and the pace figures have always
/// counted it, so the rating counts it too.</para>
///
/// <para>THE CAPABILITY CURVE. <c>S(t) = capability_base_wpm + capability_burst_wpm *
/// (capability_ref_seconds / t) ^ capability_exponent</c> is the WPM the fastest humans sustain
/// for t seconds. A window of t seconds holding <c>c</c> cells therefore has ratio
/// <c>(c / 5) / (t / 60) / S(t)</c>, its pace as a fraction of the record pace FOR ITS OWN
/// DURATION, which is what makes a 1.5 second burst and a 60 second verse comparable numbers.
/// A window is measured against <c>S(t)</c> times that window's TYPABILITY multiplier, so hard
/// lyrics buy the window a slower reference and therefore a harder ratio.</para>
///
/// <para>THE PEAK sets the RANGE. <c>ratio_0</c> is the best ratio at any eligible duration
/// anywhere on the map, and <c>stars_at_human_peak / (1 + envelope_range) * ratio_0</c> is the
/// FLOOR of the map's range: what the hardest window alone is worth. A window is eligible only
/// if it carries at least <see cref="MinimumWindowChars"/> weighted characters AND lasts at
/// least the minimum duration that cutoff implies (see
/// <see cref="ShortestCharacterWindow"/>), so a dense burst cannot set the floor from a window
/// the player never has to hold.</para>
///
/// <para>THE EXACT PEAK. The duration schedule and the 50 ms bin grid both quantise the
/// reported peak, and the sandbox carries a fork experiment that REFINES it further onto the
/// map's own character boundaries (see <see cref="RefinePeakWindow"/> for why the boundary set
/// is the whole answer rather than a hill climb, and <see cref="DensityIndex"/> for the exact
/// mass arithmetic that makes enumerating it cheap). The sandbox documents OFF as the shipped
/// model, and <see cref="exact_peak"/> holds the game there, so no rating depends on the
/// experiment unless it is switched on deliberately.</para>
///
/// <para>THE ENVELOPE decides where inside that range the map lands. Every bin takes
/// <c>env[i]</c>, the best ratio of any window CONTAINING it, and
/// <c>d = min(1, env[i] / ratio_0)</c> is how hard that bin is as a fraction of the peak. The
/// map's DIFFICULT CHARACTERS are <c>N = sum_i cells(i) * d^envelope_power</c>, with no cutoff.
/// The range fills as <c>1 - exp(-N / envelope_chars)</c>, and the rating is
/// <c>floor * (1 + envelope_range * fill)</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>THE TWO EXPERIMENTS ARE SEPARATE MULTIPLIERS ON THAT RATING. TYPABILITY
/// (<see cref="TypabilityIndex"/>) is the reference-speed adjustment and can contribute exactly
/// nothing for a map whose scores do not clear its two gates. RHYTHMIC COMPLEXITY
/// (<see cref="RhythmicComplexity"/>) is a multiplier for forced pace change, and is exactly 1
/// at strength 0. With both off this file computes the envelope model and nothing else.</para>
///
/// <para>A MAP SHORTER THAN THE SMALLEST WINDOW rates exactly zero: no scheduled window fits on
/// its timeline, so <c>ratio_0</c> is 0 and so is the range it scales.</para>
///
/// <para>Kept in step with the Star Rating Sandbox, which is where this model is tuned:
/// <c>tools/star-rating-sandbox/model.mjs</c> is the same arithmetic with every constant lifted
/// into a dial. Every constant below is that sandbox's currently active setting.</para>
///
/// <para>One reading of a map, above. The sandbox also carries a second one, the CHUNKED
/// ENDURANCE AXIS, which cuts the map into equal chunks and scores each as a window of its own,
/// and <see cref="ComputeDetail"/> takes either through <see cref="EnduranceAxis"/>. That axis
/// reads none of the peak, envelope, stamina or catch-up machinery below; see
/// <see cref="ChunkedEndurance"/> for what it does read. THE SHIPPED RATING IS THE CHUNKED AXIS:
/// <see cref="Live"/> is <see cref="EnduranceAxis.Chunked"/>, and every default-argument caller
/// (the difficulty calculator, pp, this mirror) rates through it. The envelope model
/// documented here survives as the explicit <see cref="EnduranceAxis.Envelope"/> arm, which the
/// pace statistics still read for their target figure.</para>
///
/// <para>Kept byte-for-byte in step with the game's original
/// (typebeat-osu: typebeat.Game.Rulesets.TypeBeat.Beatmaps.LyricDifficulty) so the in-game star
/// rating and the stored <c>beatmaps.difficulty_rating</c> always agree. The website computes the
/// eighteen stored (arm, stream, rate) combinations at ingest and stores them as
/// <c>beatmaps.ratings</c>; the game feeds the play's own rate, stream and judgement arm. Any
/// change here must be mirrored there and <see cref="LyricPace.VERSION"/> bumped so existing rows
/// recompute. The differences this port is allowed are the namespace, the file-scoped form, the
/// web's own <see cref="LyricLine"/> / <see cref="TimedUnit"/>, and the manifest resource names
/// <see cref="TypabilityIndex"/> and <see cref="TypabilityModel"/> read their tables under.</para>
