/// <summary>
/// Star rating for a lyric map. Each word carries a keystroke load (cost × line pressure/rhythm
/// multiplier) divided by the time you have for it; that load feeds two accumulators, a fast
/// DENSITY that decays with rest and a slow ENDURANCE (a time-constant moving average of the same
/// load), and their weighted sum is the word's "strain". A duration-weighted soft maximum
/// (log-sum-exp) over the strains is remapped to stars. The soft max means difficulty spikes
/// dominate and a subset can never rate above its superset, while summing over every word (rather
/// than one peak bucket) means a sustained hard stretch actually counts: the thing that separates
/// otherwise-equal-peak diffs. Endurance is the part that survives a rest: density is deliberately
/// leaky enough now that a single burst is forgotten within a second or two, so it is endurance
/// that carries "this section has been hard for a while" into the aggregate.
///
/// A flat per-decade LENGTH bonus is added to that (see <c>length_stars</c>), which is the only
/// place the system prices a map for being long: pp carried a length factor until backlog 152 and
/// no longer does.
///
/// Kept byte-for-byte in step with the game's port
/// (typebeat-osu: typebeat.Game.Rulesets.TypeBeat.Beatmaps.LyricDifficulty). Website computes the
/// no-mod baseline (rate = 1) plus the five other stored combinations; the game feeds the play's
/// own rate and stream. Any change here must be mirrored there and <see cref="LyricPace.VERSION"/>
/// bumped so existing rows recompute.
///
/// The LITERATE mod moves the rating exactly as a rate does, through <c>literate</c>: it is a
/// CONVERSION mod on the client (IApplicableAfterBeatmapConversion), so the cells it produces ARE
/// the authored chars and every supported punctuation mark becomes a real typed cell with a target
/// time of its own. That lengthens words, changes a line's rhythm and therefore changes the map's
/// difficulty, so the mod is priced through this rating and carries no flat pp multiplier of its
/// own (docs/pp.md, backlog 144). At <c>literate: false</c> every word is the stripped, lower-case
/// stream this method has always measured, so no existing rating moves.
